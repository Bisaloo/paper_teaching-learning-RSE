## Working Title:  Identifying core competencies of an RSE and an application with a sample curriculum.

---

**Abstract**:  
In this paper we provide a survey(?) about the experiences that people had in teaching RSE skills,
and from these experiences we derive a set of core competencies that people working in RSE should have
and we try to answer the question how deeply people should know something about the respective topics
in different carreer stages, organizations, etc...
We close with a domain specific sample curriculum.
