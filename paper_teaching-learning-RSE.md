# Teaching and Learning Research Software Engineering
## Working Title:  Identifying core competencies of an RSE and an application with a sample curriculum.

---

**Abstract**:  
In this paper we provide a survey(?) about the experiences that people had in teaching RSE skills,
and from these experiences we derive a set of core competencies that people working in RSE should have
and we try to answer the question how deeply people should know something about the respective topics
in different carreer stages, organizations, etc...
We close with a domain specific sample curriculum.

## Introduction
- background
    - RSEs have been around for a long time but the name is new.
    - RSEs have a specialist skill set that bring together technical and research knowledge.
    - Skills development traditionally provided largely through peer learning, self learning, introductory training courses not targeted specifically at RSEs, ...
    - Requirements for RSE skills growing rapidly across all domains.
- past attempts, other initiatives
- contributions

Computers and software have played a key role in the research lifecycle for many decades. Traditionally, they were specialist tools used only in a small number of fields and the Computer Scientists who maintained and programmed them needed extensive technical training over several years to gain the necessary skills and expertise. Fast forward 50-60 years and software and computation are all around us, underpinning our everyday lives. This shift is also true within research.

With the ability to capture and process ever more data, undertake larger scale, higher resolution simulations and, increasingly, to automate complex tasks through Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning approaches, computers and software are now vital elements of the research process across almost all domains. However, this shift means that there is a much greater need for core research software skills across a vast array of research fields where these were not previously required.

The people who focus on writing research software are now known as Research Software Engineers (RSEs) - a term that was coined a little over 10 years ago [Hettrick2016].  RSEs may work within one of the many Research Software Engineering teams that have been setup at universities and research organisations over the last decade, or they may be embedded within a research team. They may have a job title that officially recognises them as an RSE, or they may have a standard research or technical job title such as Research Assistant, Research Fellow or Software Engineer. Regardless of their job title, RSEs share a set of core skills that are required to write software, understand the research environment and ensure that they produce sustainable, maintainable code that supports reproducible research outputs.

Developing and maintaining these skills is time consuming and often challenging. Part of the challenge is that there is not a standard pathway to becoming an RSE and, partly as a result of this, there is something of an ad hoc approach to training within the community. We also see increasing amounts of basic-level training materials that are great to put researchers or technical professionals on a path towards gaining signifciant RSE expertise, but the trail often ends as developing RSEs want to progress to intermediate and advanced level material. In particular, recent technology developments are ensuring that there is a growing need for specialist expertise, for example in areas such as making efficient use of high-performance computing infrastructure. This is an area where there is a skills shortage and a shortage of training materials.

In this paper, we look at the challenge of understanding the core competencies that underpin Research Software Engineering and the way that these competencies may be combined to help support a more coordinated approach to future RSE skills development. The paper builds on a workshop session held as part of the German Research Software Engineering Conference (deRSE23), held in Paderborn, Germany in February 2023.

## Challenges
- Point out gaps
- What is missing

## Results

### Required Generic RSE skills
In the workshop defined a set of core skills that we believe can stand the test of time.

**ADD YOUR COMPETENCIES HERE. SPECIALIZATIONS BELOW**
#### working in a team

#### Creating documented code building blocks

#### legal things

#### building libraries

#### Use repositories



source code, research data, 
Ideas so far:
- building libraries, versioning, software discovery, social skills, communication, legal things

We will have to consider that the broad variety in the field of research software. Still, there is probably a set of skills that is relevant to all developers (versioning, code quality, documentation). This could be a Body of Knowledge (BoK). In addition, RSEs should be able to adapt to specific (domain) specific requirements/environments which requires additional competences (Body of Competences) like communication, networking, (life long) learning, ... (There is a paper from David Parnas on Body of Competences in software engineering)

Also, different software at different stages of evolution require different skills (CI, larger application architectures, ...)

If we think about competencies, we should point out which tasks the persons should be able to perform:
social skills vs. "The person is able to work in a team", "The person is able to lead a team", ...

Ideally we have a list of 7 time-invariant concepts/notions of what makes up an RSE.

### How much do different people need to know?
Explore the different dimensions that a person can require a different set of skills in.
Examples are The domain, organization, career path, ...

https://competency.ebi.ac.uk/framework/bioexcel/3.0/carreer-profiles
Remember the matrix structuring idea

### RSE specialization
Examples: HPC-RSE, Legal-RSE, RDM-RSE, OpenScience-RSE, $DOMAIN-RSE, ...
- further specialized RSE skills

### Optional RSE competencies
- Hardware Maintenance?

### How do we reach people in different stages at their career?
- We have resources, now we need to connect them to people to improve science

### Organizational Infrastructures
- Defining who should be teachers and in which structures they are
- What mindset makes up a good teacher
- Do we need an organisation for teaching RSE skills?
- Certificates? Remember that they help to define what an RSE is and therefore help the career path definition.

- Ideally over time scientific software engineering becomes part of the curricula at universities 

## Required Next steps
### Implementation Strategies
#### Academic Considerations
- Awareness of existing teaching programs
- "Branded" Add-on courses
- External Institutions provide resources
- fully recognized in the academic system. Students get ECTS points.
- Bachelor/Master specializations

#### Broader Considerations
- Instilling more respect for people that want to educate themselves for digital competencies
- Outreach to people that now have the feeling that they require this training.

## Conclusion
?

## Appendix
### An applied example curriculum

### An example of a possible career path
- We can follow Kim, who has been the protagonist of the original deRSE Paper.
