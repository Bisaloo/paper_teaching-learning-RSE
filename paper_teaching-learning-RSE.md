# Teaching and Learning Research Software Engineering
## Working Title:  Identifying core competencies of an RSE and an application with a sample curriculum.

---

**Abstract**:  
In this paper we provide a survey(?) about the experiences that people had in teaching RSE skills,
and from these experiences we derive a set of core competencies that people working in RSE should have
and we try to answer the question how deeply people should know something about the respective topics
in different carreer stages, organizations, etc...
We close with a domain specific sample curriculum.

## Related Work and Activities

The challenges of understanding the current state of skills within the research software community and related areas, as well as identifying required competencies, developing training pathways and providing training materials are areas that are being looked at and addressed by various groups and projects. In this section we highlight some of these other projects and activities.

### Identifying skills and pathways

As an area that generally requires a range of advanced skills, High Performance Computing (HPC) is one field where there is ongoing work to identify relevant sets of skills for HPC practitioners and potential paths to develop these skills. The HPC Certification Forum has developed a "competence standard" (CS) for HPC that defines a range of skills and how they are related in the context of a skill tree [HPC-CF Competencies]. Also looking at pathways and how different skills are related, the UNIVERSE-HPC project [UNIVERSE-HPC], funded under the UK's ExCALIBUR research programme [EXCALIBUR], is looking to understand and develop training pathways to support the development of specialist skills in the HPC and exascale domains. The project is gathering open source training materials to develop curricula that support the training pathways that are underpinned by high-quality training materials.

 - There are some projects / papers looking at skills pathways - if we're going to include a separate section on related work, as proposed here, this should probably be expanded to include more of this content?

### RSE-related Training Materials

A wide range of software-related training materials and supporting organisations exist within the research software community and beyond. The Carpentries [The Carpentries] is a non-profit entity that supports a range of open source training materials and international communities of volunteer instructors and helpers who run courses around these materials. The community also maintains the materials which are based around three core syllabuses - Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry and Library Carpentry. The training materials within these areas have been developed, reviewed and enhanced over several years ensuring that they represent best practice in training on these topics. The core Carpentries lessons are targeted primarily at the beginner-level. However, the Carpentries Incubator [Carpentries Incubator] provides an environment for hosting additional community developed training modules covering a wide range of other topics that haven't gone through the peer review process of the core lessons. The material in the Incubator increasingly includes more intermediate-level training modules.

CodeRefinery is another group who host a set of open source training material that they use in workshops primarily run in the Nordic region. CodeRefinery's material includes both beginner and intermediate-level material _[Samantha to expand descriptio of CodeRefinery?]_

## Results

### Required Generic RSE skills
Ideas so far:
- building libraries, versioning, software discovery, social skills, communication, legal things

We will have to consider that the broad variety in the field of research software. Still, there is probably a set of skills that is relevant to all developers (versioning, code quality, documentation). This could be a Body of Knowledge (BoK). In addition, RSEs should be able to adapt to specific (domain) specific requirements/environments which requires additional competences (Body of Competences) like communication, networking, (life long) learning, ... (There is a paper from David Parnas on Body of Competences in software engineering)

Also, different software at different stages of evolution require different skills (CI, larger application architectures, ...)

If we think about competencies, we should point out which tasks the persons should be able to perform:
social skills vs. "The person is able to work in a team", "The person is able to lead a team", ...


Ideally we have a list of 7 time-invariant concepts/notions of what makes up an RSE.



### How much do different people need to know?
Explore the different dimensions that a person can require a different set of skills in.
Examples are The domain, organization, career path, ...

https://competency.ebi.ac.uk/framework/bioexcel/3.0/carreer-profiles
Remember the matrix structuring idea

### RSE specialization
Examples: HPC-RSE, Legal-RSE, RDM-RSE, OpenScience-RSE, $DOMAIN-RSE, ...
- further specialized RSE skills

### How do we reach people in different stages at their career?
- We have resources, now we need to connect them to people to improve science

### Organizational Infrastructures
- Defining who should be teachers and in which structures they are
- What mindset makes up a good teacher
- Do we need an organisation for teaching RSE skills?
- Certificates? Remember that they help to define what an RSE is and therefore help the career path definition.

- Ideally over time scientific software engineering becomes part of the curricula at universities 

## Required Next steps
### Implementation Strategies
#### Academic Considerations
- Awareness of existing teaching programs
- "Branded" Add-on courses
- External Institutions provide resources
- fully recognized in the academic system. Students get ECTS points.
- Bachelor/Master specializations

#### Broader Considerations
- Instilling more respect for people that want to educate themselves for digital competencies
- Outreach to people that now have the feeling that they require this training.

## Conclusion
?

## Appendix
### An applied example curriculum

### An example of a possible career path
- We can follow Kim, who has been the protagonist of the original deRSE Paper.
