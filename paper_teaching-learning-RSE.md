# Teaching and Learning Research Software Engineering
## Working Title:  Identifying core competencies of an RSE and an application with a sample curriculum.

---

**Abstract**:  
In this paper we provide a survey(?) about the experiences that people had in teaching RSE skills,
and from these experiences we derive a set of core competencies that people working in RSE should have
and we try to answer the question how deeply people should know something about the respective topics
in different carreer stages, organizations, etc...
We close with a domain specific sample curriculum.

## Introduction
- past attempts, other initiatives
- contributions

## Challenges
- Point out gaps
- What is missing

## Results

### Required Generic RSE skills
In the workshop defined a set of core skills that we believe can stand the test of time.
#### working in a team

#### Creating documented code building blocks

#### legal things

#### building libraries

#### Use repositories
source code, research data, 
Ideas so far:
- building libraries, versioning, software discovery, social skills, communication, legal things

If we think about competencies, we should point out which tasks the persons should be able to perform:
social skills vs. "The person is able to work in a team", "The person is able to lead a team", ...
Ideally we have a list of 7 time-invariant concepts/notions of what makes up an RSE.

### How much do different people need to know?
Explore the different dimensions that a person can require a different set of skills in.
Examples are The domain, organization, career path, ...

Remember the matrix structuring idea

### RSE specialization
Examples: HPC-RSE, Legal-RSE, RDM-RSE, OpenScience-RSE, $DOMAIN-RSE, ...
- further specialized RSE skills

### How do we reach people in different stages at their career?
- We have resources, now we need to connect them to people to improve science

### Organizational Infrastructures
- Defining who should be teachers and in which structures they are
- What mindset makes up a good teacher
- Do we need an organisation for teaching RSE skills?
- Certificates? Remember that they help to define what an RSE is and therefore help the career path definition.

## Required Next steps
### Implementation Strategies
#### Academic Considerations
- Awareness of existing teaching programs
- "Branded" Add-on courses
- External Institutions provide resources
- fully recognized in the academic system. Students get ECTS points.
- Bachelor/Master specializations

#### Broader Considerations
- Instilling more respect for people that want to educate themselves for digital competencies
- Outreach to people that now have the feeling that they require this training.

## Conclusion
?

## Appendix
### An applied example curriculum

### An example of a possible career path
- We can follow Kim, who has been the protagonist of the original deRSE Paper.
