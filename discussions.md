# Things to be discussed
Due to forking issues can only be opened on Heidis repo, so I suggest we can discuss open topics here.


## Debugging
In my "experienced RSEs" group one skill almost everyone wished for was debugging.
I'm not sure whether this really fits in core competencies or if there should be a broader competency of SE skills where this fits into.

## Master's programme
I think a core challenge would be to open this to SEs as local domain lecturers would have to be open to teach them some domain.
Nevertheless, there are good master's courses aimed at different groups already. 

One example from Hannover is the wind energy engineering master where some courses are for everyone and some courses are depending on the 
Bachelor degree of the students and aimed at teaching civil engineers some of the mechanical and electrical engineering skills needed and vice versa.

But of course a curriculum for domain Bachelors to learn SE skills is somewhat easier to design.
